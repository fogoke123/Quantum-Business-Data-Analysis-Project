# Quantum-Business-Data-Analysis-Project
The Category Manager for Chips in a large retail shop wants to understand better the types of customers who purchased chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region. The insights from this analysis will help the supermarket’s strategic plan for the chip category in the next half year.

Supermarkets will regularly change their store layouts, product selections, prices and promotions. This is to satisfy their customer’s changing needs and preferences, keep up with the increasing competition in the market or to capitalise on new opportunities. As a Business data analyst my responsiblities are to engage these processes to evaluate and analyse the performance of change and recommend whether it has been successful. 

To be successful in this project I will be engaging the following skills. 

Data wrangling
Data visualization
Programming skills
Statistics
Critical thinking
Commercial thinking
